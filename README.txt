Apache Commons Policy:

This is an implementation of WS-Policy Specification (September,2004) which 
can be located at:http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/09/policy/

It provides a convenient model and an API to process policy information at 
runtime. This framework is heavily used in Apache Axis2, Apache Sandesha2, 
Apache WSS4J (as an experimental feature) and now gaining its maturity.
