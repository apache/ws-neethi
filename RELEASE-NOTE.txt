Apache Neethi-3.1.0 Release Notes:

3.1.0 is a minor update to 3.0.x.  The main difference in this vesion is
that equals and hashCode methods have been added to the base assertion
types.  Code that relied on the "system" equals/hashCode implementation
may need to be updated.

Apache Neethi-3.0.0 Release Notes:

This is a "major" upgrade to Neethi that completely revamps the Neethi 
internals to make it more usable for projects that have varying dependency
requirements.  The API impact is minimal.   The major impact from an API 
perspective is the upgrade to Java 5 typed collections as well as the 
support for WS-Policy 1.5 "ignorable" attributes.   

Major new features:
* Support for WS-Policy 1.5.  This includes the new ignorable attribute.
The Policy.intersect method has also been implemented to support this.

* API changed to use Java 5 typed collections.  Thus, support for Java 1.4 
has been dropped.

* AssertionBuilders can now be written that build assertions from DOM or
StAX in addition to the Axiom implementations.

* The PolicyEngine and AssertionBuilderFactory singletons have been 
removed.  PolicyEngine now wrappers a "PolicyBuilder" singleton, but 
applications are recommended to create and configure their own PolicyBuilder
object based on their needs.
